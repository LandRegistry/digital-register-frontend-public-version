## About this Service

Use this service to get a summary of who owns or leases a property, including:

* what was paid for the property (provided it was bought after April 2000, cost more than £100 and HM Land Registry recorded this information)
* if there’s a mortgage on it
* its unique property title number
* the property’s rough extent and location on a map

The summary tells you when the title was last changed and can change if HM Land Registry receives an application. This service cannot tell you if a change is being processed.

You can only view your purchased information once and print a copy. Copies of the summary and VAT receipt can be downloaded.

Use [HM Land Registry’s Find a Property service](https://eservices.landregistry.gov.uk/wps/portal/Property_Search) instead if you need more detailed information, such as the official title plan, full legal register entry or details of any access rights and restrictions.

**By using this service you accept the terms of use set out on this page. Each term of use is separate. If any court decides any is unlawful the rest will continue to be fully effective. You can stop using this service at any time. HM Land Registry can stop you from using this service if you don’t comply with its terms of use.**

## Using the service – your contract with HM Land Registry

By using the Find property information service (‘the service’), you have the ability to:

* search for a property by postcode
* select a property from a list of property addresses that match your search
* view, print or download title summary information for a property for the fee stated

By using the service you agree to be bound by and pay for any purchase you make.

Because the information is provided immediately, once you pay for it you lose the right of cancellation you would normally have under The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.

This means that by making a request to view, print or download title summary information, you:

* agree to pay the fee for the service by making an online transaction (through RBS Worldpay or a replacement online payment provider)
* agree the summary will be provided as soon as you have paid
* accept you lose your right to cancel once the summary is displayed

When it accepts your request, HM Land Registry enters into a contract with you to provide title summary information at the time and date of your transaction. You can end this contract at any time before you make payment. The contract is between you and HM Land Registry and no-one else can enforce any of its terms.

The online payment provider will confirm your purchase and provide a transaction reference.

Your contract with HM Land Registry ends when the title summary information is delivered.

HM Land Registry is not liable to you or any third party for any losses arising from delays to the provision of services or the completion of your order, for example through:

* interruptions to transmission of data over the internet
* services provided by third parties
* inaccuracies in the content of linked websites

## Information HM Land Registry holds about you

HM Land Registry’s Find property information service will hold the following information about you:

* your email address
* your password
* your postal address
* your telephone number (if you provide one)

## How HM Land Registry protects your personal information

HM Land Registry complies with the requirements set by the Data Protection Act 1998 and European Parliament Directives.

It uses personal information you provide in accordance with its [personal information charter](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry/about/personal-information-charter) to:

1. supply title summary information to you
2. process your payment for this information
3. record the purchase

HM Land Registry will only share your personal information with other organisations if the law requires or allows it to do so. It will:

* make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t
* only keep the information for as long as it’s needed
* not make it available for commercial use, such as marketing, without your permission

Your order information can be shared with other teams in HM Land Registry or other organisations where this is needed to process your application.

There are some cases when your information can be shared for other reasons, for example to prevent crime.
